# CS390 IoT Applications: Drone Control for 3D Modeling

### Overview
This independent study project involves developing an application to control the flight of a drone. The drone will capture video and images that will later be processed to create 3D models of indoor and outdoor environments. These models will be used for Virtual Reality applications, allowing for immersive exploration of buildings, places, and objects.
